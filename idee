Vague Idea:
1) to make a network able to generate Indian Classical music.
2) main idea is considering Music as a story being every note and the alankar as a word.
	and considering this story as a set of feature information in time series.
	Hence following approach should work properly in Initial Projection:
		(i) Use of some sort of RNN(Recurrent Neural Network)
		(ii) Ideally should use a frequency generation approach
		(iii) To make it as a tool a MIDI generation approach should also work
		(iv) for performances, the frequency to MIDI conversion on top of bullet(ii) should be appropriate.
3) WorkFlow:
	(i)Train the  model
	(ii) use it for verbal generation
